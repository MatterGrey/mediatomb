   conflicting with libuuid, so the sources had to be taken in and some
   renaming needed to be done.

   Independent implementation of MD5 (RFC 1321).

   This code implements the MD5 Algorithm defined in RFC 1321.
   It is derived directly from the text of the RFC and not from the
   reference implementation.

   that follows (in reverse chronological order):

   1999-11-04 lpd Edited comments slightly for automatic TOC extraction.
   1999-10-18 lpd Fixed typo in header comment (ansi2knr rather than md5).

   The code used in these files come directly from dpkg.

   This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
   The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
   written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
   This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.

   Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
   This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
   except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
   with every copy.

   To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
   MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
   needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
   will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.

   Changed so as no longer to depend on Colin Plumb's `usual.h' header
   definitions; now uses stuff from dpkg's config.h.
    - Ian Jackson <ian@chiark.greenend.org.uk>.
   Still in the public domain.
